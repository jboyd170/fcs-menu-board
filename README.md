# FCS Menu Board

This repository includes a portion of my FCS 2024-2025 Capstone project.

For this project, I parsed my school's lunch menu site and displayed it on a html file to be imbeaded on our digital screens.

# The process
- Parse the menu website for this weeks menu's
- Parse today's menu for the lunch items
- Get the main menu items and put them in an array
- Get every other item and put them in an array
- Insert each item into formatted html
- Insert the formatted elements into the main html
- Save the html file
- Use Github Actions to run the code and serve the html file to Github Pages
